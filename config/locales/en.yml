      about:
        copy:
          introduction:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p class=\"lead\">Needle in a Haystack Childcare is a specialist nanny referral agency; we work solely with families who have children with additional needs (and their siblings) in the Boston Metro area. We provide experienced nannies, buddies, mentors and childcare workers for positions that may be full or part-time, daily or live-in, temporary and permanent.</p>"
            paragraph_2_html: "<p>We deal with placements for babies, children and teens with a range of additional needs including mild learning difficulties, physical or learning disabilities and social-emotional and behavioral needs.</p>"
            paragraph_3_html: "<p>At Needle in a Haystack we understand that being a mainstream nanny and being a special needs nanny are two completely different roles&mdash;and they require different types of people.</p>"
            paragraph_4_html: "<p>The Needle in a Haystack process involves extensive nanny screening, rigorous background checks and comprehensive family interviews to ensure a strong and nurturing relationship for both the family and the nanny. We know that families and nannies have a very personal relationship that isn&rsquo;t always easy, but our agency&rsquo;s goal is to find that perfect fit while providing our clients with an exceptional experience.</p>"
            paragraph_5_html: "<p>Our goal is to make the process of locating, hiring, and retaining specialized care for your children as easy and stress-free as possible.  We meet this goal by providing your family with personalized attention and take the pain out of screening, scheduling, and vetting potential candidates.</p>"
          our_founder:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p>Needle in a Haystack Childcare was founded by Robert Jones in Weston, MA.  Robert sought out to become an expert in caring for children on a full-time basis while employed as a counselor at a camp serving children with serious illnesses and conditions. Robert enjoyed working with children so much that he decided to continue his education and study Psychology while working as a full-time nanny.</p>"
            paragraph_2_html: "<p>While working full-time, Robert graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Cambridge College in Cambridge, MA. After receiving his degree, Robert set his mind on studying abroad and expanding his experiences which led him to Roehampton University in London, UK where he received his Master’s in Education. During his time as a full time student in Massachusetts and the UK, Robert has enjoyed many different positions highlighting his passion for helping children, specifically with special needs, ranging from Elementary School Teacher and Learning Support Specialist to Behaviour Technician and Nanny.</p>"
            paragraph_3_html: "<p>His work has included collaborating with parents, teachers, teammates and other professionals while carrying out individualised lessons and behavioral plans. Robert has worked in integrated classrooms as well as 1:1 with children aged four to fifteen years in home and community settings. Robert is exceptional in his ability to provide fun and loving but structured and firm environments for children to develop and reach their individual potential.</p>"

        title: About Us
      nannies:
        copy:
          introduction:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p>Working as a nanny can be very different from other childcare positions. Because a nanny works within a private home, the lines between being an employee and a friend of the family can get blurred. It is a very personal job looking after someone&rsquo;s child, if your workplace is also your home, the lines can easily become less clear.</p>"
            paragraph_2_html: "<p>To make sure everyone knows where they stand and what is expected of them, it is imperative to set guidelines and have a clear grasp of individual roles. We will provide a contract so that specific details are written out and understood by both parties. It&rsquo;s very easy to assume on either side. It is usually easier with daily positions, but clarity is still needed.</p>"
          duties:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p>The duties of a nanny are those that relate to the child. You will be responsible for providing a safe, stimulating environment for them, as well as making sure their clothes, bedrooms, toys, etc. are clean and tidy. You will be required to cook healthy meals and tidy up after the children. You will not be expected to do general cleaning or cooking for the family. </p>"
          different_titles:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p>In addition to special needs nannies and babysitters; we also place tutors, mentors and buddies. Typically these are with older children who have a greater level of ability, but need assistance to enable them to access different levels of activities, education and socialization.</p>"
          children_with_additional_needs:
            paragraph_1_html: "<p>Working as a special needs nanny is very different from being a mainstream nanny. It is possible that at times you will be working alongside other professionals such as speech and language therapists, physical and occupational therapists and teachers. There can also be opportunities presented for training in various new areas.</p>"
            paragraph_2_html: "<p>Sometimes our positions involve working on a one-to-one basis with a child with special needs, other times it may involve working with siblings as well. Where a child&rsquo;s special need is severe, it is unlikely that any other duties will be involved. </p>"
            paragraph_3_html: "<p>As a special needs nanny, it is vital to remember that the parents of the child you are looking after may still be coming to terms with the fact that their child has a disability or illness. It is important that you remain sensitive to this. A good special needs nanny will be aware of a child&rsquo;s limitations, but also help them reach their full potential. First and foremost the child you are looking after is a child. It is secondary that they have additional needs.</p>"
            paragraph_4_html: "<p>Because all of our positions are with babies and children with additional needs, we only recruit people who really want to work in this area&mdash;it is not an easy choice. Ideally you will have experience with children with special needs and this experience may come from a variety of settings: schools, voluntary work or even having a child or sibling with additional needs. If you have great mainstream experience, but no special needs experience, we may still be able to help you with one of our various positions. Every child is different and nannies and carers need to learn about each individual child&rsquo;s needs. On the job training will sometimes be available as well.</p>"
            paragraph_5_html: "<p>The most important criteria&mdash;is having the right attitude, to be able to see the needs of the whole family and to want to help a child reach their potential, whatever that may be.</p>"
